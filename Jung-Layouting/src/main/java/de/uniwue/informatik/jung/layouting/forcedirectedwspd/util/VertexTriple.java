/**
 * Object that is used as vertex in one drawing of one graph.
 * It is an {@link Triple} that consists of the 3 elements (in this order):
 * <ol>
 *  <li>
 *   Vertex data of variable type (specified with generic V).
 *   This is used in JUNG-{@link Graph}s to specify a vertex.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   A {@link Point2D}-object that is the location of the vertex within the drawing.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   A {@link FRVertexData}-object (this inherits from {@link Point2D}).
 *   It is here the computed displacement in one iteration of some graph-drawing-algorithms.
 *   It is used by the algorithm in the class {@link FRLayoutNoMaps} and the algorithms in the classes that have
 *   {@link FRLayoutNoMaps} as super-class.
 *   This value has no application or meaning after or outside the calculation of the graph drawing.
 *  </li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In the graph-drawing-classes ({@link Layout}-classes) from the JUNG-library there are no {@link VertexTriple}s used.
 * There the locations of the vertices are stored in (Hash-){@link Map}s.
 * Given one vertex (as an object of some vertex data V) of a {@link Graph}, a {@link Layout} ({@link AbstractLayout})
 * of this graph (there may be many layouts to that graph) returns a location (point-object) by using that {@link Map}.
 * In practice that is a little slower (but only constant time, no asymptotically higher time in practice) than having references
 * to the vertex data and to the location of the vertex
 * in one layout saved together in one object, so this class was created to replace the Maps.
 * Force-directed graph-drawing algorithms implemented in JUNG such as {@link FRLayout} or {@link FRLayout2}
 * calculate a displacement of each vertex in each iteration (displacement induced by many single
 * attractive and repulsive forces). To get this displacement-vector/point for every vertex there is also a {@link Map} used.
 * To speed up the accesses to these values in practice also a little a reference to that calculation-intern value is saved
 * directly in the new class {@link VertexTriple}, too.
 * The algorithms in the classes {@link FRLayoutNoMaps} and classes that have it as super-class (most notably
 * {@link FRWSPD}, {@link FRQuadtree}) use a {@link Collection} of those {@link VertexTriple}s
 * as data structure. This is a little faster when iterated over all elements of the {@link Collection}.
 * If it is used in contexts where queries (give vertex data, get location in the layout) of arbitrary, single vertex-objects
 * (type vertex data V) should be answered, a hashmap from the vertex data to the corresponding {@link VertexTriple}s
 * should be added or the older structure (map: vertex data -> point) should be used instead.
 * <p>
 * The class {@link EdgeTriple} was created for the same reason/use analog to {@link VertexTriple}.
